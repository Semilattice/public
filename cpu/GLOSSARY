clk

    The clock, an oscillator. Whenever the clock switches from low to high, the
    CPU advances to the next state.

pc

    The program counter is the index (in bits) of the instruction to decode and
    interpret. The program counter is modified by every instruction, except for
    jump instructions that jump to themselves.

opcode

    The opcode is part of an instruction, and defines which functionality to
    perform. The opcode is scrutinized in a large case statement, each branch
    of which contains some code to implement the opcode and interpret the
    instructions that start with that opcode.

regop

    A register operand of an instruction, specifying which register is to be
    read or written by the instruction.

immop

    An immediate operand of an instruction, which is a literal number.
